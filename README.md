This is a simple interactive lab that lets you play
around with multi-layer neural nets.

Its core engine is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's
[micrograd][] engine, and I made it to solidify
my understanding of the concepts he taught in
his [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).

## Quick start

To run it, you'll need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and run:

```
cargo run --release
```

Once the window opens, you can press `H` for help.
