A fork of an old `android-rs-glue` crate, compatible with building miniquad-based projects.

# Supported `[package.metadata.android]` entries

```toml
# The target Android API level.
# "android_version" is the compile SDK version. It defaults to 29.
# (target_sdk_version defaults to the value of "android_version")
# (min_sdk_version defaults to 18) It defaults to 18 because this is the minimum supported by rustc.

# If a value is not specified for a secondary target, it will inherit the value defined in the `package.metadata.android`

# The Java package name for your application.
# Hyphens are converted to underscores.
# Defaults to rust.<target_name> for binaries.

# Environment Variables
Cargo-apk sets environment variables which are used to expose the appropriate C and C++ build tools to build scripts. The primary intent is to support building crates which have build scripts which use the `cc` and `cmake` crates. 

- CC : path to NDK provided `clang` wrapper for the appropriate target and android platform. 
- CXX : path to NDK provided `clang++` wrapper for the appropriate target and android platform. 
- AR : path to NDK provided `ar`
- CXXSTDLIB : `c++` to use the full featured C++ standard library provided by the NDK.
- CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE : the path to the generated CMake toolchain. This toolchain sets the ABI, overrides any target specified, and includes the toolchain provided by the NDK.
- CMAKE_GENERATOR : `Unix Makefiles` to default to `Unix Makefiles` as opposed to using the CMake default which may not be appropriate depending on platform.
- CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM: Path to NDK provided make.

# C++ Standard Library Compatibility Issues
When a crate links to the C++ standard library, the shared library version provided by the NDK is used. Unfortunately, dependency loading issues will cause the application to crash on older versions of android.  Once `lld` linker issues are resolved on all platforms, cargo apk will be updated to link to the static C++ library. This should resolve the compatibility issues.
